      <h2>About GEB</h2>
      <p>I'm a local musician and singer/songwriter. I play acoustic guitar and sing my original songs. My music is influenced by a wide range of genres including folk, country, and indie. I started playing guitar and writing songs when I was a teenager, and I've been performing around town ever since.</p>
